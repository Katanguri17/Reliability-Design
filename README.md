# Malware Discovery with Machine Learning

This is a repository for a university project on the **"Cybersecurity, Reliability and Risk Lab"** module. It aims malware discovery with chosen algorithms, like *K-Nearest Neighbors*, *Decision Tree* or *Naive Bayes*.
### Description
Project implementation is held with python 3.8. Three simple Machine Algorithms are used for comparison: KNN, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes. Data to fed and teach algorithms is a CSV file with 56 features and label a colum. 
The repository includes a Jupyter Notebook with code snippets and its description.

### Prerequisites

A couple of non-standard python libraries are used. To install them, use the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
